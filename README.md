# Neurominer-Changes-GraphKernels
## The patch file with all the changes I made to the Neurominer code


In order to add the changes to your Neurominer code, download the *patch.patch* file into the same directory as the *Neurominer-1-main* folder (downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/neurominer-git/NeuroMiner-1).

Then, navigate to this directory in the terminal and execute the command **patch -p1 -d 'NeuroMiner-1-main' < patch.patch**

As a result, the *Neurominer-1-main* folder will contain my changes.
